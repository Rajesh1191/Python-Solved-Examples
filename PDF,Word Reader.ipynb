A company that depends on short (quick win) sales cycle often relies on proposal managers, where as organisations that depends on longer term, complex sales processes depends on bid managers. In addition to managing bids, bid managers work closely with company board directors and C-level management to set the strategic direction of the business by providing insight into\\xa0\\xa0through direct exposure to critical feedback from failed bids and the evolving needs of clients.\",\n",
       "  4: \"Bid managers' salaries differ across the construction industry depending on the company and, moreover, the specific project. According to a survey conducted in 2010 the average salary of a bid manager in the UK construction industry, including a bonus, is £120,250 per annum. Certain projects are more financially beneficial depending on the nature of the project or sector. For example, bid managers working on\\xa0\\xa0earn an average salary of £80,000, whilst\\xa0\\xa0projects make a lower figure of £40,000. However, bonuses can be accumulated at a rate of at least 20–60% of the salary. For example, a salary of £50,000 can be given and depending on performance, a 60% bonus will be given on top of the salary, bringing the total earnings to £70,000 or more.\",\n",
       "  5: \"Bid managers play an important role in\\xa0, where they produce and manage bids for companies structured to take on outsourcing projects from the government and industries. These bids run anywhere between three and 18 months (on average about six months), involve substantial bid budgets (as much as $5 million for very large bids over $100 million in value) and large teams of between 10 and 100 people. The bid manager ensures that all customer-specified milestones are met and all deliverables of the bid are produced as specified. A bid manager's performance is normally evaluated based on the percentage of contracts he or she wins. Bid managers typically work with teams collected together from line functions for the temporary duration of the bid project, and hence need to have strong leadership skills to manage bids successfully. Good bid managers are in strong demand in the outsourcing industry.\"}}"

However, when \\nthey approached Mindfire Solutions their Code was not in the best condition and they had to restart the \\nservers on a daily bas\\nis and there were times when the messaging broadcast would fail randomly. \\n \\nIn this scenario, Mindfire had its task cut and proceeded with a modular approach giving more \\nweightage to the more pressing issues first.\\n \\nThe Mindfire Solution:\\n \\nThe primary custome\\nrs of our client were\\n \\nAdvertiser\\ns \\nwho\\n \\ncan get distributed Shortcode or they can \\nown a Shortcode. \\nThe Advertiser can set up campaigns for Restaurants, Comedy Clubs, College, Real \\nEstate etc. They \\ncan\\n \\nalso\\n \\ns\\net Zip Code location processing for a \\nscheduled \\nBroadcast.
